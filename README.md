## Welcome! 

I started this project over winter break because I was bored and I discovered upon returning home that my desktop could no longer run video games at above 20fps. 

To view the project, go to http://boseongkim32.github.io/my2023 and click around to see the website. For source code, go to src folder and take a look around. Enjoy!
